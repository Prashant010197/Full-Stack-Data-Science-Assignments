    "/\n",
    "+\n",
    "6\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Operators are placeholders that can initiate a specific operation. For instance, * or Asterisk initiates the multiplication operation on values or Operands given to it. Operators in the question are * - / and +. Operands are 'hello', -87.8 and 6. Based on the values entered, an operand can also work in operator overloading."

A variable is a name to which memory is allocated for storing data(integer, float, string etc) temporarily. The name for a variable cannot be a number, should not be a built-in function and should not have any special characters."
