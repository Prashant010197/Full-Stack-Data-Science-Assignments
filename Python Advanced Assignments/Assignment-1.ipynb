    "Python's OOP gives the language capability such that programming can be done while defining attributes or templates and  real world object's properties can be specified using the templates. In essence, Python's OOP brings the programming language closer to the real world. In addition to that, concepts like Inheritance (reduces redundancy and improves code extensibility), Encapsulation (hides data from the user which they should not see), Abstraction (hides data from user that they need not see), Polymorphism (based on input, an operator or function can be overloaded or overriden) can be implemented too."
